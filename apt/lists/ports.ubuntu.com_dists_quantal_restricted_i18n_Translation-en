Description-en: Tool of configuring the NVIDIA graphics driver
 The nvidia-settings utility is a tool for configuring the NVIDIA
 Linux graphics driver.  It operates by communicating with the NVIDIA
 X driver, querying and updating state as appropriate.  This
 communication is done with the NV-CONTROL X extension.
 .
 Values such as brightness and gamma, XVideo attributes, temperature,
 and OpenGL settings can be queried and configured via nvidia-settings.

Package: sl-modem-daemon
Description-md5: dd33edc29e8f6ca6bd7aaea974c49391
Description-en: SmartLink software modem daemon
 The SmartLink modem daemon is the application part of the
 driver for recent modems produced by Smart Link Ltd.
 .
 This package replaces (along with hardware access drivers) the old
 driver generation (2.7.x) which consisted of kernel modules only.
 .
 It needs a kernel driver to access the hardware. This can be either
 recent ALSA (shipped with a newer kernel (>=2.6.4) with ALSA support
 and snd-intel8x0m module) which is sufficient for basic operation and
 data/Internet connection, or the SmartLink kernel driver which is
 provided by separate packages which you can build using the source from
 the sl-modem-dkms package.
